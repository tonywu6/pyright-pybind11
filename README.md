# Pyright & pybind11

Run [`./demo.sh`](./demo.sh) to execute this example from start to finish.

---

Trying to figure out how to package type information together with [pybind11]
modules.

[pybind11]: http://pybind11.readthedocs.io

This example builds and packages a `calculator` module using pybind. The package
has the following structure:

- _module_ `calculator`
  - `add(a: int, b: int) -> int`
  - _submodule_ `subtract`
    - `sub(a: int, b: int) -> int`

Tested on macOS 13.5.1 (Apple Silicon) and in a [Dev Container] with Debian
bullseye.

[Dev Container]: ./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json

## Prerequisites

- Conda, to manage Python environments and dependencies.
- Your system should also meet the minimum requirements for building C++
  (`make`; `gcc` or `clang`, etc.)

## Building the bindings

Create a new conda environment in `.venv` using
[`environment.yml`](./environment.yml), and then activate it.

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix .venv \
  && conda activate $(realpath .venv)
```

The environment uses Python 3.8.17, and installs the following packages:

- pybind11
- [CMake], for generating the build system
- [MyPy], for generating type stubs

[CMake]: https://pypi.org/project/cmake/
[MyPy]: http://mypy.readthedocs.io

Conda also installs the necessary Python/pybind11 headers as well as pybind's
CMake input files, which CMake will need.

Generate the build system:

```bash
cmake .
```

CMake will use [`CMakelists.txt`](./CMakeLists.txt). Your command output should
look similar to the following (paths and compiler versions may vary):

> ```
> -- The CXX compiler identification is AppleClang 14.0.3.14030022
> -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
> -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
> -- Check for working CXX compiler: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/c++ - skipped
> -- Detecting CXX compile features
> -- Detecting CXX compile features - done
> -- Found PythonInterp: ... (found suitable version "3.8.17", minimum required is "3.6")
> -- Found PythonLibs: .../.venv/lib/libpython3.8.dylib
> -- Found pybind11: .../.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pybind11/include (found version "2.11.1")
> -- Configuring done (0.5s)
> -- Generating done (0.0s)
> -- Build files have been written to: ...
> ```

Build the bindings:

```bash
make
```

This creates a dynamic library `calculator.*.so` in the current directory. Your
command output should look similar to the following:

> ```
> [ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/calculator.dir/calculator.cpp.o
> [100%] Linking CXX shared module calculator.cpython-38-darwin.so
> [100%] Built target calculator
> ```

It is now possible to import the module from Python:

```py
>>> import calculator
>>> calculator.add(1, 2)
... 3
```

## Generating type stubs

Generate type stubs from the built bindings using MyPy's [stubgen] command:

[stubgen]: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html

```bash
stubgen --package calculator --output typings
```

The stubs will be written to `typings/calculator`.

> ```
> Processed 2 modules
> Generated files under typings/calculator/
> ```

## Installing & testing

Create a new conda environment inside `example/.venv` using
[`example/environment.yml`](./example/environment.yml), and then activate it:

```bash
conda env create --file example/environment.yml --prefix example/.venv \
  && conda activate $(realpath example/.venv)
```

This time, the environment installs [MyPy], [Pyright], and the `calculator`
package we just built.

[Pyright]: https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/

See what files were installed:

```
pip show -f calculator
```

> ```
> Name: calculator
> ...
> Files:
>   ...
>   calculator.*.so
>   calculator/__init__.pyi
>   calculator/py.typed
>   calculator/subtract.pyi
> ```

Run the example script:

```bash
python example/main.py
```

> ```
> 41 + 1 = 42
> 43 - 1 = 42
> ```

## Comparing MyPy and Pyright

The example script contains a typing error:

```py
# def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
add(41, "1")
```

Type-check with MyPy:

```bash
mypy example/main.py
```

> ```
> example/main.py:10: error: Argument 2 to "sub" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"  [arg-type]
> Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
> ```

Type-check with Pyright:

```bash
pyright example/main.py
```

> ```
> .../example/main.py
>   .../example/main.py:3:6 - warning: Import "calculator.subtract" could not be resolved from source (reportMissingModuleSource)
>   .../example/main.py:10:37 - error: Argument of type "Literal['1']" cannot be assigned to parameter "arg1" of type "int" in function "sub"
>     "Literal['1']" is incompatible with "int" (reportGeneralTypeIssues)
> 1 error, 1 warning, 0 informations
> ```

`calculator.subtract` is a submodule generated by pybind11 which has no
corresponding source on the filesystem (the entire `calculator` package is in a
single `.so` file).

Here, Pyright warns about not being able to resolve it from source, but MyPy
does not. Notice also that Pyright still reports the type error correctly thanks
to our type stubs.
